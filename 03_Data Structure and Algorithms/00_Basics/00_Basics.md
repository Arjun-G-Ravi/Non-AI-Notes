# Basics of Data Structures

### HOW TO APPROACH A DSA PROBLEM:
    (1) Understand problem. Note the input data and output dataâ€™s properties.
    (2) Figure out the data structure required
            1. Array
            2. Hash Map
            3. Stack
            4. Queue
            5. Linked List
            6. Tree
            7. Graph
            8. Heap/ Priority Queue
    (3) Find if any general technique is applicable
            1. Two pointer technique
            2. Sliding Window technique
            3. Recursion
            4. Backtracking
            5. Dynamic Programming
            6. Greedy
            7. Divide and conquer
    (4) Make algorithm, write it fully in shortest form. Check for side cases
    (5) Code it up
