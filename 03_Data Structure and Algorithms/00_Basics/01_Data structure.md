# Data structure 
- refers to the structure in which we store data
- is of two types
    - Linear :  Array, Linked Lists, Stack, Queue
    - Non-Linear: Trees, Graphs, heaps

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)
An ADT is a high-level description of a data structure that defines a set of operations that can be performed on the data structure and the behavior of those operations. It focuses on what operations can be performed and what their expected behavior is, rather than how those operations are implemented.

An example would be 'stack'. Stack is an ADT that supports push and pop(and has all the other things that you know). When talked about in this sense, the implementation of stack(using an array, or linked-list or any other) doesn't matter.
