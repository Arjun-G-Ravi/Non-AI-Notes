# Backtracking

Backtracking is a more refined and optimized version of brute force that intelligently explores the search space, avoiding unnecessary work whenever possible. This is done by generating a state space trees and searching for a solution via Depth First Search. Backtracking speeds the exhaustive search by cutting tree branches selectively (pruning).
