# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems in a table to avoid redundant computations. This technique is particularly useful for optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of feasible solutions.

`It will always give the optimal solution.`
