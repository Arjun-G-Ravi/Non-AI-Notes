# COW INVADERS
This is my attempt to create space invaders with pygame, except it is Cow invaders

## The game
- Cow has to kill the monsters before it gets to the farmhouse
- The cow can either shoot or headbutt to kill the monsters
- The headbutt is a more superior way to kill (as you will realise as you play the game), but will increase the enemy spawn rate by 2 times.

## Challenge
Try to get to 300

# Future plans
- Cow will be able to jump to kill the enemy
- The cow will get boost from random grass appearences, which will lead to various things
- The cow will get update as the score gets higher, to control the massive enemy waves
