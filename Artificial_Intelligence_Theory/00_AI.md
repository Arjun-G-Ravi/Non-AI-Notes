# Introduction to AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as the branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior.
Another defenition of AI is the development of algorithms and software that enable computers to perform tasks that would typically require human(higher level) intelligence.

### The four approaches to AI
1. Acting Humanly: Turing test approach
2. Thinking Humanly: Imitating the thought process in human brain
3. Thinking Rationally: Logic via 'Laws of thought'
4. Acting Rationally: 

### Fields of AI

<!-- # Agent
An agent is just something that operate autonomously, perceive their environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt to change, and create and pursue goals. 
A rational agent is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome. -->
