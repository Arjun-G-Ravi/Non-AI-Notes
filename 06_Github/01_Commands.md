# GIT COMMANDS

1. git init: Initialise a repository to be maintained by git
2. git clone #Repo SSH#: Clone the repo into your local machine. It also init the repo.
3. git status: Checks the current status of the repo
4. git remote add origin #SSH github#: To link a local repo to our new github repo
5. git log: To see log of the commit
6. FETCH: Downloads all the changes in the remote repo, but doesn't merge (and hence affect) your local repo
   - git fetch --all: Fetches all the branches to local repo
7. ADD
   - git add .: Adds every change in the current working directory to git. The dot can be replaced with file name.
8.  COMMIT
   - git commit -m 'Commit msg': Commits the current repo
   - git commit -am 'comm msg': Adds and commits. Works only if the file is aldready added. ie, for modified files.
9.  PUSH: Push the specified branch to remote repo, along with all of the necessary commits and internal objects.
   - git push origin master: This pushes the repo remotely. 
   - git push: If you have done git push -u origin master one time, you just have to git push in the future
   - git push --force: Force push the current repo to remote. This will overwrite commit history
10. PULL: It is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.Conceptually, you can think of git pull as a combination of git fetch followed by git merge.
    - git pull: Fetch the specified remoteâ€™s copy of the current branch and immediately merge it into the local copy.
    - git pull --rebase: The --rebase option can be used to ensure a linear history by preventing unnecessary merge commits.
11. BRANCHING THINGS
   1.  git branch: Lets you see all the branches.
   2.  git checkout -b #branchName#: Create a new branch
   3.  git checkout #branchName#: Switch to another branch
   4.  git diff #branchName# : Shows differecce between main and #branchName#
   5.  git branch -d #branchName#: Delete the branch
   6.  git merge #branchName#: Merges #branchName# to current branch
12. RESET
    1.  git reset: Undo add .
    2.  git reset HEAD~1: Undo last commit. HEAD is the pointer to the last commit. This asks git to point HEAD to one commit before.
    3.  git reset #commitVal#: Resets to that commit val. The commit cal can be seen in git log
    4.  git reset --hard #CommitVal#: This not just undos the commit but also deletes the changes they have made
13. GIT CONFIGURATION
    - git config pull.rebase false: You are calling for manual merge conflict
