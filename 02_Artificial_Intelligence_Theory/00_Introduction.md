# Introduction to AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as the branch of computer science that is concerned with the automation of intelligent behavior.

Another defenition of AI is the development of algorithms and software that enable computers to perform tasks that would typically require human(higher level) intelligence.

### The four approaches to AI
1. Acting Humanly: Turing test approach. Try to make AI act like human, as much as possible.
2. Thinking Humanly: Imitating the thought process in human brain - cognitive modeling
3. Thinking Rationally: Logic via 'Laws of thought' - thinking in the most optimal way
4. Acting Rationally: Trying to make an agent act rationally in an environment - trying to achieve the best expected outcome.
