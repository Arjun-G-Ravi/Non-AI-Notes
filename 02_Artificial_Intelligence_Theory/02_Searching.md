The common techniques to problem solving by AI are:
- Search algorithms
- Knowledge representation and reasoning
- Machine Learning( + NLP + CV)
- Expert systems
- Genetric Algorithms, etc.

# Search Algorithms
General Purpose search algorithm can be classified into two:
 1. Uninformed search: Search where we have no information about the search space.
 2. Informed search: There is some sort of guidance to aid the search.

# Problem solving
- Goal formulation, based on the current situation and the agentâ€™s performance measure, is the first step in problem solving.
- Problem formulation is the process of deciding what actions and states to consider, given a goal.
