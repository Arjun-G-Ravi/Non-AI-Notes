# GNU/ Linux

GNU/Linux(commonly reffered to as linux) is a popular open source UNIX-like operating system that uses Linux kernel and GNU tools.

Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the worldâ€™s smartphones are powered by Linux(Android comes from linux).

# Linux Origin Story

- Richard Stallman and a group of people aimed to create an open-source UNIX based operating system. It was named GNU.
- During this time, a young prodigy Linus Torvalds was working to create his own kernel known as Linux.
- At that time, GNU lacked a kernel. So, Linus combined his kernel with the existing operating system to create a full operating system. This was the first open source operating system.
- Thus linux is the name of the kernel used in the operating system. Its just a piece of the OS that connects the software to the hardware. Many people call the operating system itself as Linux. It should be called GNU/Linux.

# Children of GNU/Linux

There is a whole bunch of OS that spawned from UNIX. They all use similar directory system, and hence similar terminal commands.
It includes Linux based OS like ubuntu, fedora and kali, MacOS, Android, etc.

Windows doesn't fall in this class, and has a separate terminal.

# True UNIX and UNIX-like

True UNIX refers to operating systems that are certified as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification, which is a set of standards for operating systems that conform to the original UNIX design principles. It costs money, and effort for this certification.
Eg: Solaris (Oracle), AIX (IBM)

UNIX-like operating systems, also known as Unix-like or Unix-compatible, are not certified as true UNIX but share many of the same design principles and features. They generally don't go True because either of money or effort reasons. Some don't certify as it defeats the purpose of being open source.
Eg: Linux, macOS

# Linux Distributions

A linux distribution is a Linux kernel, some GNU tools, documentation, desktop manager, and whole lot of other things. There are 1000s of linux distros.
Eg:

- Debian: Robust and stable Linux distribution, Serves as the basis other distributions, including Ubuntu.
- Ubuntu: Derived from debian. User friendly, and most popular.
- Linux Mint: Out-of-the-box usability, comes with the Cinnamon desktop environment, Great choice for newcomers to Linux. Derived from ubuntu.
- Fedora: Cutting edge of open-source technologies
- Arch Linux: Rolling-release distribution favored by advanced users, minimal base installation, and users build their systems from the ground up.
- Kali Linux: Specialized distribution designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking.
- Slackware: Oldest Linux distributions and is known for its simplicity and minimalism.

# Terminal and Shell

The terminal, also known as a command-line interface (CLI) or console, is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with the shell(and thus the OS) by typing commands. It serves as a user interface for entering and executing commands.

The shell is a command interpreter, which is a program that takes the commands entered by the user via the terminal and interprets them for the operating system. It is called shell as it hides the kernel.

Eg:

- **Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)**: Default shell on many Linux distributions. Bash is known for its scripting capabilities and is highly customizable. It provides a robust set of features for both interactive use and scripting.
- **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)**: Fish is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. It offers features like syntax highlighting, autosuggestions, and a helpful web-based configuration interface.
- **Zsh (Z Shell)**: Zsh is an extended shell that offers many interactive features and advanced scripting capabilities. It includes features like advanced auto-completion, themes, and plugins. Macs these days use Z Shell.
