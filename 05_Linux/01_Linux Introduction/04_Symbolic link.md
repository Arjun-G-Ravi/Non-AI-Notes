# Symbolic Link

A symbolic link, often referred to as a symlink or soft link, is a special type of file in a file system that acts as a reference or pointer to another file or directory. Unlike a hard link, which directly points to the inode of the target file or directory, a symbolic link contains the pathname of its target.
