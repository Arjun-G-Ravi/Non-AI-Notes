# Theory of Computation
The essence of the theory of computation is to help develop mathematical and logical models that run efficiently and to the point of halting. It primarily about what kind of things can be computed mechanically, how fast and in how much space.

It has 3 main branches:
1. Automata Theory - The study of abstract machines (or more appropriately, abstract 'mathematical' machines or systems) and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. 
2. Computability Theory - This theory deals primarily with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer. 
3. Complexity Theory - This theories considers not only whether a problem can be solved at all on a computer, but also how efficiently the problem can be solved.
