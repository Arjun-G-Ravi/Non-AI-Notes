# Basic Terms

1. Symbol: A letter/ character. Eg: a,b ...
2. Alphabet(Σ): Set of symbols (to be used to make strings)
3. Strings: Sequence of characters
4. Language: Subset of Σ*. It is essentially a collection of strings that follows a certain rule
5. Grammar:A grammar refers to a set of production rules that define the structure of a language. It is a mathematical formalism used to describe the syntax of a language. 
6. Automata: Language genarator/ acceptor. Returns yes/no

# Automata Theory 
This area studies abstract machines or models that can perform computations. These include finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. It investigates the capabilities and limitations of these machines in solving various problems.
