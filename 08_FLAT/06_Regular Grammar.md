### Production Rules:
- Regular grammars use production rules of the form A → α, where A is a non-terminal symbol, and α is a string of terminals and/or non-terminals.
- The right-hand side of each production rule can only have one of the following forms: A → aB, A → a, or A → ε, where "a" is a terminal symbol, "B" is a non-terminal symbol, and ε is the empty string.
