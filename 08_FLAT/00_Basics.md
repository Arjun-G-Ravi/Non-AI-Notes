# Automata Theory - Theory of Computaition
This area studies abstract machines or models that can perform computations. These include finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. It investigates the capabilities and limitations of these machines in solving various problems.

# Finite State Machine
A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to design and describe the behavior of systems with a finite number of states.
