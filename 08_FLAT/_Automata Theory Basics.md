# Regular Grammar
A regular grammar refers to a type of formal grammar that generates a regular language, which is a type of formal language in theoretical computer science. They are the simplest class of formal languages in the Chomsky hierarchy, which categorizes formal languages based on their generative power.

# Context Free Grammar

Context Free languages can be generated by context-free grammars and recognized by pushdown automata. 
CFL provide a higher level of expressive power compared to regular languages, making them more suitable for representing the hierarchical and nested structures found in programming languages and other complex systems. This increased expressiveness comes with a trade-off in terms of parsing complexity.
