# Linter

A linter will look at your code and comment on it. It could give you tips about mistakes youâ€™ve made, correct trailing spaces, and even predict bugs you may have introduced.

# Passive linter - Flake9
A popular linter that comments on the style of your code in relation to the PEP 8 specification is flake8. Just run `flake8` on a file or directory.

# Aggressive Linter - Black
It forces the code changes. Run `black` on the directory or on the file that you want to force change.
