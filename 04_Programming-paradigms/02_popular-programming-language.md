# Types of programming languages

### Declarative (focuses on what to accomplish, not how)
* functional - uses mathematical functions to solve problems (e.g., Haskell)
* dataflow - computations based on data dependencies (e.g., LabVIEW)
* logic/ constraint-based - uses logical rules to express computations (e.g., Prolog, SQL)

### Imperative (focuses on how to accomplish tasks)
* von Neumann - based on sequential execution of instructions, widely used, basic means of computation is the modification of variables (e.g., C)
* object-oriented - organizes code into objects with data and behavior (e.g., Java)
* scripting - automates tasks and glues components together (e.g., Python, bash, lua, perl, php)

`The classification is not a thing that all agree on. Some languages can be classified in multiple categories. Some people think different - functional languages are imperative, etc.`

# Different Programming Languages

1. Ada
   - Designed for embedded and real-time systems
   - Strong emphasis on safety and reliability
   - Used extensively in aviation and military applications

2. Fortran
   - First high-level programming language
   - Specialized for scientific and numerical computations
   - Still used in high-performance computing

3. C
   - Low-level programming with high-level syntax
   - Provides direct memory manipulation
   - Foundation for operating systems and embedded systems

4. C++
   - Object-oriented extension of C
   - Supports multiple programming paradigms
   - Popular in game development and system programming

5. Java
   - Platform independent ("Write once, run anywhere")
   - Strong focus on object-oriented programming
   - Widely used in enterprise applications

6. Python
   - Easy to learn, readable syntax
   - Extensive library support
   - Popular in data science and web development
