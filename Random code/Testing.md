## Unit Tests
- Focus on one tiny bit of functionality.
- Should be fast, but a slow test is better than no test.
- It often makes sense to have one testcase class for a single class or model.

## Functional Tests
Functional tests are higher level tests that are closer to how an end-user would interact with your application. They are typically used for web and GUI applications.
