# Theory of Computation
The essence of the theory of computation is to help develop mathematical and logical models that run efficiently and to the point of halting. It primarily about what kind of things can be computed mechanically, how fast and in how much space.

`The branch of computer science that explores the capabilities and limitations of computation is known as theory of computation or computational theory. It builds and analyses mathematical models to probe computation in the abstract.`

It has 3 main branches:
1. `Automata Theory` - The study of abstract mathematical machines and the computational problems that can be solved using these machines. By using mathematical models, we can strip away all of these superfluous details and better understand the capabilities of the underlying model. Weâ€™ll see that an surprisingly simple model of computation is capable of representing any computation.

2. `Computability Theory` - This theory deals primarily with the question of the extent to which a problem is solvable on a computer. It explores the capabilities and limits of computation.

3. `Complexity Theory` - This theories considers not only whether a problem can be solved at all on a computer, but also how efficiently the problem can be solved. It investigates the complexity of algorithms by analysing the resources - primarily time and space, that they require.

# Computer
A computer is any machine that performs a computation by executing a defined sequence of operations, known as an algorithm. The particular state of the machine at any given moment indicates the state of the computation. It is something that takes a list of operations and converts them into some kind of observable form. It doesn't even need to have a physical form, by this definition.
