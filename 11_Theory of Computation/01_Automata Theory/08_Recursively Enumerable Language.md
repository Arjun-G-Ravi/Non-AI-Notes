# 3. Recursively Enumerable language

A recursively enumerable language (RE language), also known as a Turing-recognizable language, is a type of formal language that can be recognized by a Turing machine.

It means that for any recursively enumerable language, there exists a Turing machine that, if run indefinitely, will generate all and only the strings of the language, possibly in an unordered sequence.

Recursively enumerable languages are significant in theoretical computer science because they represent the limits of what can be recognized by a computational system. They help in understanding the boundaries between what can be computed or recognized and what lies beyond the capabilities of Turing machines.
