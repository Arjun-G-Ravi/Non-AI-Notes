# Function
A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of possible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output. 

# Domain and range of a function
- **Domain**: The set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.
- **Range**: The set of all possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce.
 
# Graph of a function
The graph of a function is a visual representation of the relationship between the input and output values. It is typically plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system, where the x-axis represents the input values and the y-axis represents the output values. Each point on the graph corresponds to an input-output pair.

# Vertical and horizontal asymptotes
Asymptotes are lines that a graph approaches but never touches.
- **Vertical asymptotes** occur when the output approaches infinity as the input approaches a certain number. This can be calculated from a function y = f(x) by finding values of x that make the denominator zero (if applicable).
- **Horizontal asymptotes** occur when the output approaches a constant value as the input approaches infinity or negative infinity. This can be determined by evaluating the limits of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity.

# Limits
A limit is a value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value.

# Continuity
A function is continuous if there are no breaks, jumps, or holes in its graph. Formally, a function f(x) is continuous at a point x = c if:
`lim xâ†’c f(x) = f(c)`
