## Norm
The norm of a vector, often denoted by ‖v‖ is a measure of the length or magnitude of the vector. 
Eg: Manhattan Norm (L1 norm), Euclidean Norm (L2 norm), etc.

## Inner product
A positive definite, symmetric bilinear mapping Ω : V ×V → R is called an inner product on V. Dot product is a type of inner product.

### Orthogonal vectors
Vectors v1 and v2 are mutually orthogonal if ```v1.v2 = 0, for v1 != v2```

## Orthonormal basis
An orthonormal basis is a set of vectors in a vector space that is both orthogonal and normalized.
i.e, the basis vectors are orthogonal to each other, and have been normalised to have a length of 1.
Eg: i,j,k in the 3d space

# Projection
Projection, in mathematics, refers to the process of mapping a vector onto a subspace. The most common type of projection is the orthogonal projection, which involves projecting a vector onto a subspace in a way that the projected vector is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the subspace. 
Orthogonal projections are used in ML to visualise a higher dimensional graph, without the loss of valuable information. PCA works with this.

## Inner product of functions
Inner product of two functions is defined as:

# Rotation
A rotation is a linear mapping that rotates a plane by an angle θ about a fixed point, the origin.
