# Matrix decomposition
Matrix decomposition, also known as matrix factorization, refers to the process of expressing a matrix as a product of two or more matrices, often with specific properties. These factorized matrices can provide insights into the structure of the original matrix and are useful in various mathematical and computational applications. 

# Determinant
The determinant is a scalar value that can be calculated from the elements of a square matrix. It has several important applications, particularly in solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues, and understanding linear transformations.

Geometrically, the determinant of a square matrix can be interpreted as a scaling factor that represents how much the matrix transforms the volume (or, more generally, the "size") of a geometric object in space.

### Trace
The sum of diagonal elements of a matrix.

# Characteristic Polynomial
The characteristic polynomial is a concept in linear algebra that is associated with square matrices. Given a square matrix A, the characteristic polynomial is obtained by finding the determinant of the matrix A−λI, where λ is a scalar variable, and I is the identity matrix of the same size as A. The characteristic polynomial is obtained by solving `det(A−λI)= 0`.

The roots of the characteristic equation are the eigen values of the of the matrix.
