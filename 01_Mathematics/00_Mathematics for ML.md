# ML
Machine Learning is data compression. We feed a lot of data into a model(function). This model will now be used to predict the functional value of an input, which was never present in the training data.
i.e, The goal of machine learning is to design general purpose methodologies to extract valuable patterns from data, ideally without much domain-specific expertise.
