# Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is our 'good old algebra' that focuses on the study of vector spaces and linear mappings between those spaces. Algebraic representation of linear algebra problems are called linear equations. Geometrically, there will be no curves in a graphical representaion of a linear algebra problem.
