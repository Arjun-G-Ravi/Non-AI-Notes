# Linear Functions/ Linear Transformation/ Linear Mapping
It's a mathematical function between two vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. Geometrically, a linear mapping takes vectors from one space to another in a way that maintains the structure of those vectors.
`Geometrically, it transforms the vector space such that the transformed grids are parallel and evenly spaced.The origin also retains its intitial position.`
Eg: Rotaion, Skew

# Representation as Matrices

Transformation is generally represented as matrices where each column represent the new basis vector. Thus every vector in the initial space is matmuled with this transformation matrix to get the transformed vector.

Multiplying two transformation matrix results in the combination of perfoming that both that linear transformation sequentially.

### Kernel/ Null space
The kernel of a linear transformation, also known as the null space, is the set of all vectors that map to the zero vector under that transformation. In other words, it consists of the inputs that get "flattened" to zero when the transformation is applied.

### Image
In the context of linear algebra and linear transformations, the term "image" refers to the set of all possible output values that a linear transformation can produce.
