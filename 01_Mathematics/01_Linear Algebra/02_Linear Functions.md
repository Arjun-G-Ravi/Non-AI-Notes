# Linear Functions/ Linear Transformation
It is a transformation that that transforms one vector space into another. It maintains additivity and scalar multiplication in the vector spaces. 
`Geometrically, it transforms the vector space such that the transformed grids are parallel and evenly spaced.`
Eg: Rotaion, Skew

# Representation as Matrices

Transformation is generally represented as matrices where each column represent the new basis vector. Thus every vector in the initial space is matmuled with this transformation matrix to get the transformed vector.
