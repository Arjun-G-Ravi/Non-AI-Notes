# Programming Paradigms

A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to programming that provides a way to structure and organize code. Each paradigm represents a different philosophy for solving computational problems.

Key aspects of programming paradigms:
- Define how program execution flows
- Determine how data is organized and manipulated
- Influence how code is structured and maintained
- Impact problem-solving approaches

Common characteristics:
- Each paradigm has its own strengths and weaknesses
- Languages often support multiple paradigms
- Choice of paradigm depends on the problem domain
- Understanding multiple paradigms makes you a better programmer

# Why study multiple programming languages?
- Understand obscure features
- Choose among alternative ways to express things
- Make good use of debuggers, assemblers, linkers, and related tools
- Simulate useful features in languages that lack them
- Make better use of language technology wherever it appears
