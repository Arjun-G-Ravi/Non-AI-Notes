# TMUX - terminal multiplexer
tmux is a program which runs in a terminal and allows multiple other terminal programs to be run inside it.

## Primary uses
- Protect running programs on a remote server from connection drops by running them inside tmux.
- Allow programs running on a remote server to be accessed from multiple different local computers.
- Work with multiple programs and shells together in one terminal, a bit like a window manager.

## TMUX concepts
- tmux keeps all its state in a single main process, called the tmux server.
- Panes are the individual sections within a window that can be split and used for different tasks.
- Windows, on the other hand, are the separate environments within which these panes exist.
