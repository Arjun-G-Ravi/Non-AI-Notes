# Layering
Layering in computer networks involves organizing communication protocols into a series of abstraction layers. Each layer has a specific function and interacts with the layers above and below it. The layers are designed to be modular, allowing for easier development, maintenance, and interoperability of network protocols.

# Protocols
Set of rules that governs data communication.

# Layer Architectures
1. OSI Reference model
2. TCP/IP model

# OSI Reference model

- Open System Interconnection
- Not a protocol :0
- Just a guideline for a flexible, robust network architecture. Hence called reference model
- Intended to show a way to faciliate communication without changing the underlying logic in hardware. 
- Never fully implemented. It is used for education and testing though.
- Very modular, and easy to troubleshoot

# TCP/IP model

- Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
- Heirarchical protocol, made up of interactive modules- each providing a special funcitonality
