# Computer Networks
- A set of nodes connected by communication links.
- A network can be defined as a group of computers and other devices connected in some way so as to be able to exchange data. Each of the devices on the network can be thought of as a node, each node has a unique address.
- A computer network has three components:
    - Nodes
        - End nodes: Computers, printer, etc
      - Intermediate nodes: Switches, bridges
    - Transmission media
        - Wired/ Guided
        - Ethernet: Data transferred as electrical signals
        - Fibre optics: As light waves, fastest
        - Coaxial: For video and audio. As electricity
        - USB cable: Universal serial bus. 
    - Wireless/ Unguided
        - IR: Short
        - Radio: Bluetooth, Wifi
        - Microwaves: Cell phone. Longer
        - Sattelite communication
    - Services
        - Instant messaging, file sharing, Information and web services, entertainment, etc. 

# Properties of CN
1. Fault Tolerance: Ability of network to work regardless of failures. ie, if a failure occurs in a path the network has to find another path to get the information through.
2. Scalability: Ability of netowork to grow based on needs, and still retain its performance
3. QoS: Quality of Service refers to ability to set priorities and manage traffic.
4. Security and privacy
  
# Types of Networks
1. PAN - Personal Area Network
   - one person in a building
   - Eg: Wireless keyboard, printers, etc.
2. LAN - Local Area Network
   - Privately owned network in a building
   - To share resources and exchange information
   - Also called enterprise networks
   - Comes as:
     - Wired LAN - Ethernet
     - Wireless LAN - WiFi
3. MAN - Metropolitian Area Network
   - Spans an entire geographical area (like a city)
   - Used to connect LANs
   - Eg: Cable TV
4. WAN - Wide Area Network
   - Even larger geographical area (like a country or a continent)
5. Internetworks
   - A collection of interconnected networks is called an internetwork or internet.

# Network protocols
They are a set of rules that define how the communication between two nodes takes place.
It determines:
 - Message encoding
 - Formatting and encapsulation(of source, destination information)
 - Message delivery option
   - Unicast: Sender sends to exactly one reciever
   - Bicast: More than one reciever, but not all
   - Broadcast: To all revievers.
 - Timing
 - Size, etc.
