# 1. Repeater
- Operates in physical layer
- Extends reach of network by amplifying and retransmitting signal
- Simple device, no data modification
- May introduce delay in transmission
- Unable to manage traffics
- Being replaced now by more intelligent devices

# 2.Hubs
- Operate at physical layer
- Connects multiple devices in a network and allows them to communicate with each other.
- Serves as a central connection point for devices on a network, and facilitates communication by broadcasting data to all connected devices.
- Simple device - no security, ability to manage traffic, filtering
- Being replaced now by more intelligent devices

# 3. Bridges
- Operate at the data link layer, uses MAC address for forwarding
- A network bridge is a device that connects and filters traffic between two or more network segments, making them function as a single network. 
- Manages collision, thus improving overall efficiency of the network
- Reduces unnecessary traffic, by providing data to required nodes only
- Adapts to changes in the network, ensuring efficient and accurate forwarding decisions.

# 4. Switches
- Operate in data link layer
-  They are essential components in local area networks (LANs) and are used to connect multiple devices within a network, enabling efficient communication.
- Unlike hubs or simple bridges, switches provide more intelligent and efficient handling of network traffic.
- They build and maintain a MAC address table that maps MAC addresses to specific switch ports
- Switches use the MAC address table to forward frames only to the port where the destination device is located- reduces traffic
- Supports 
    - collision domain separation
    - Broadcase handling
    - Full duplex communication
    - VLAN support
    - Larger data handling capability
    - Better scalability
- Switches have largely replaced older technologies like hubs and simple bridges in modern networks.

# 5. Routers
- Operate in Network layer
- Routers connect different networks together and facilitate the exchange of data between them.
- They route data between different IP addresses
- Can do dynamic routing
- Supports 
  - Subnetting
  - Address translation
  - Firewall functionaliy
  - Packet filtering
  - WAN connectivity

# 6. Gateways
- operate at the application layer
- A gateway is a network device or software application that serves as an entry point or interface between two different networks, allowing them to communicate and share information. 
- Gateways can translate data between different communication protocols. 
- They have
  - Data Format Conversion
  - Security Features
  - Bi-directional Communication
  - Network Segmentation
