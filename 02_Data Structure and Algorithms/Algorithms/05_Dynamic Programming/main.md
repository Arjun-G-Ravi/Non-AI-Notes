# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into `simpler overlapping subproblems` and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems in a table to avoid redundant computations. This technique is particularly useful for optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of feasible solutions.

- It will always give the optimal solution.
- We typically apply dynamic programming to optimization problems.

```
When developing a dynamic-programming algorithm, we follow a sequence of
four steps:
1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively deÔ¨Åne the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.
