# Flags - command-line arguments
Terminal command flags, often referred to as "command-line options" or "command-line arguments," are additional parameters that you can add to a command to modify its behavior or provide extra information. These flags are typically preceded by a hyphen (e.g., -f) or two hyphens (e.g., --force) and are used to customize the command's operation. Flags are a fundamental part of working in a command-line environment, as they allow you to fine-tune commands according to your specific needs. 

# Important flags
Sometimes same letter can be used for multiple flag application.

1. -v: To verbosely display what the command just did
2. -r:  Indicate that an operation should be applied recursively, e.g., when copying directories.
3. -i: Interactive. Prompt for confirmation before overwriting or deleting files.
4. -h: Help
5. -v: Version
6. -q: Quiet. Supress the output
7. -f: Force the command to execute even if it might overwrite or delete existing files.
8. -y: Automatically answer "yes" to prompts or confirmations.
9. -a: all. Including hidden files
10. -l: Long. Display detailed information.
11. -h: Display file sizes in a human-readable format (e.g., 1K, 2M).
